Configure your application to use `localhost` as your SMTP server, and all
emails will be intercepted and displayed in this software.

FakeSMTP uses SubEthaSMTP: an easy-to-use server-side SMTP library for Java.

FakeSMTP is free to use for commercial and non-commercial projects and the
source code is provided.

The fakeSMTP.jar is auto-executable.
If your desktop environment supports it, you can directly double click
on the .jar file.
Otherwise, run the following command:

    java -jar fakeSMTP-VERSION.jar
